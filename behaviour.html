      In order to reproduce, bamboo plants use rhiozomes, which are basically roots that can send out shoots through the dirt to create new plants. This process is known as self-seeding. This is why bamboo forests exist; all the bamboo plants must be connected by rhiozomes unless they are created through seeds, which is another form of reproduction for bamboo plants. Another way bamboo plants reproduce is through flowering, which in turn produces seeds via fruits, but very rarely do bamboo plants flower.
