      <p class="eComm">  Bamboo is usually found in warm and tropical regions of the world, specifically in Southeast and East Asia, Africa and South America, although they can also be found growing in the American South and Northern Australia. They especially prefer moist and humid conditions, which is why they are so common in East Asia. There are no native bamboo species in Canada and much of the Northern United States because of the climate, but attempts have been made to grow it on a commercial basis.
