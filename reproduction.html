        Like many other grasses, bamboo plants have more than one reproduction technique.
        
        <br>
             
        <br>
        
        The primary form of reproduction for bamboo is through rhiozomes, which are roots that travel through the ground and form shoots, called culms, which grow from the ground, effectively creating a new bamboo plant. This process is asexual, and is called vegetative propagation.
        
        <br>
            
        <br>
        
        Another form of reproduction for bamboo is through flowering. Unfortunately, this form only happens every 30-100 years, depending on the species of bamboo. The bamboo plant will flower, and many seeds are created as a byproduct of flowering. The seeds will either fall to the ground and grow a new bamboo plant, or will be eaten and excreted by animals, which will cause it to grow far away from the original plant. It is important to know that every single bamboo plant of the same species will flower at the same time period. The length of the time period is usually around two years long. After flowering the bamboo plant dies, but by then its seeds from the bamboo fruits have been spread to different locations. This is important because it could create new bamboo forests, which are an important part of many animals' diets, such as the giant panda, and provide an ecosystem for many other animals as well. This is a type of sexual reproduction and required fertilization.

        These types of reproduction offer a lot of advantages, and little disadvantages. Reproduction by rhiozomes combined with the bamboo's rapid growth cycles means that the growth of bamboo is more than the consumption of bamboo (usually for commercial purposes or used for food for animals), which allows it to have a sustainable population. A disadvantage of flowering is that the bamboo fruits will flood the are with bamboo seeds, causing a boom in rodent populations, which can cause damage to the ecosystem by consuming everything. The rodents can also carry dangerous diseases such as typhus.

        The conditions required for bamboo to reproduce are quite similar to other plants. If there is not enough rain, then the rhizomes will not grow, meaning new bamboo plants cannot be grown. If it is too wet, then there may be damage to the root systems and new bamboo plants  will not grow. For flowering, bamboo plants are quite unique because of the specific time they flower. There is very little research on the conditions required for a bamboo plant to flower, because it happens so rarely. Obviously, there needs to be proper soil, sunlight, and nutrients, but scientists do not know why bamboo plants flower using this process.
